Stat Blocks
===========

A means of generating creature stat blocks like those found in the
Dungeons & Dragons® Monster Manual™. Using the template and an example, it is
easier to create a .tex file for the desired stat block. This .tex file can
then be converted to a pdf using pdflatex or some other method for easy 
printing.
